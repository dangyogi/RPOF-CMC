    single: notices; how delivered

Unless otherwise indicated in this Constitution, the bylaws of this County Executive Committee, the
`Rules of Procedure`_ of the Republican Party of Florida, or the `Constitution of the Republican Party
of Florida`_, all required notices may be provided by e-mail, unless a member has indicated in writing
to the Chairman and/or Secretary that they would prefer to receive notice by U.S. mail. Once a
member has made such an indication it is good until such time as the member indicates otherwise.
Notice sent by U.S. mail shall be deemed provided on the date postmarked. To the extent such
notice applies to a special meeting all required documentation pursuant to `Article VII`_ shall be
attached to the e-mail notification. If a member challenges the sufficiency of an e-mail notification,
the Secretary shall provide proof to the member that the notice was timely provided.
